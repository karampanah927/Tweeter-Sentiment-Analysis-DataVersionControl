# Sentiment Analysis on Tweets

## Project Overview

This project performs sentiment analysis on tweets collected from the internet, using machine learning to classify tweet sentiment. The aim of this project is to analyze public opinion in real-time, providing valuable insights into users' emotions and trends.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Model**: We use a machine learning model to predict the sentiment of tweets, classifying them as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Flask Application**: The project includes a Flask application, allowing users to interact with the model and view the sentiment results.
- **Data Version Control**: Our project is equipped with data version control on GitHub, making it easy for team members to manage and update datasets collaboratively.

## Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: Tweets are collected and preprocessed for analysis.
2. **Model Training**: A machine learning model is trained on the dataset, with data updates managed through version control on GitHub.
3. **Flask Deployment**: The model is deployed in a Flask application, which serves as an interface for analyzing tweets in real-time.
4. **Data Version Control**: By utilizing data version control, team members can seamlessly update datasets and retrain the model, ensuring that the latest data is always available for analysis.
